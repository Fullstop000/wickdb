### Plan & Progress

#### The basic shape of LevelDB

- [x] Fundamental components
  - [x] Arena
  - [x] Skiplist
  - [x] Cache
  - [x] Record
  - [x] Batch
  - [x] Block
  - [x] Table
  - [x] Version
  - [x] VersionEdit
  - [x] VersionSet
  - [x] Storage (aka Env)
  - [x] DB
- [x] Compaction implementation
- [x] Scheduling

#### [ongoing] Test cases & Benches

- [ ] Solid test cases
- [ ] Benchmark

#### Remove unsafe codes

We should use Rust as safe as we could because that's why we prefer using Rust.

- `Slice` could be replaced using crate [bytes](https://docs.rs/bytes).
- `LRUCache` is a double-linked circle list implemented by raw pointer.

### Developing

`wickdb` is built using the latest version of `stable` Rust, using [the 2018 edition](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/).

In order to have your PR merged running the following must finish without error otherwise the CI will fail:

```bash
cargo test --all && \
cargo clippy && \
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

You may optionally want to install `cargo-watch` to allow for automated rebuilding while editing:

```bash
cargo watch -s "cargo check --tests"
```

There're so many `TODO`s in current implementation and you can pick either of them to do something.

This crate is still at early stage so any PR or Issue is welcomed !.
